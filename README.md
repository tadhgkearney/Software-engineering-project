# Software-engineering-project
Third year project to produce a multipart calculator that takes an input from the tokenizer_input.txt file.
## How to compile
Compile by running the make file by calling `make` on the command line.
## Short explanation
* Starts with a tokenizer file which seprerates the input into pieces.
* The infix to postfix file converts this input into postfix notation.
* The code generator turns each of these instructions into machine instructions.
* The virtual machine then runs each of these commands in postfix notation.
